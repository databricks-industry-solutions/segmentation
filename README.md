**Transform customer data into actionable business insights with modern RFM analysis and behavioral segmentation.**

## üéØ Industry Use Case

Customer segmentation is the foundation of modern marketing strategy, enabling businesses to:
- **Increase revenue by 20%** through targeted campaigns
- **Improve customer lifetime value** across all segments  
- **Enhance marketing efficiency** with precision targeting
- **Reduce customer churn** through proactive engagement

This solution demonstrates a paradigm shift from traditional demographic-only segmentation to **behavioral-driven customer intelligence**, using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with advanced clustering techniques to create actionable customer segments.

## üöÄ What is Customer Segmentation?

Customer segmentation divides your customer base into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. This solution creates **6 distinct customer segments**:

1. **High-Value Loyalists** - Premium customers generating highest revenue
2. **Frequent Shoppers** - Regular customers with consistent purchase patterns
3. **Discount Hunters** - Price-sensitive customers responding to promotions
4. **Occasional Buyers** - Sporadic purchasers needing engagement
5. **New/Inactive Customers** - Recent sign-ups or dormant accounts
6. **Category Specialists** - Customers focused on specific product categories

Each segment receives tailored strategies with **150-200% expected ROI** for high-value segments.

## üì¶ Installation

This solution uses [Databricks Asset Bundle](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/bundles/index.html) for deployment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/customer-segmentation.git
cd customer-segmentation

# Deploy to Databricks
databricks bundle deploy

# Run the complete workflow
databricks bundle run customer_segmentation_demo_install
```

### Prerequisites

## üîÑ Segmentation Pipeline

The solution implements a **3-stage customer segmentation pipeline**:

### Stage 1: Data Setup
- Generates **1,000 synthetic customers** with realistic demographics
- Creates **transaction history** with seasonal patterns and behavioral variety
- Stores data in **Unity Catalog managed tables**

### Stage 2: Segmentation Analysis (DLT)
- **RFM Analysis**: Calculates Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores
- **Behavioral Clustering**: Groups customers by purchase patterns
- **Segment Profiles**: Creates business-ready segment characteristics

### Stage 3: Business Insights
- **Interactive Visualizations**: 5 essential charts using Plotly
- **Actionable Recommendations**: ROI-focused strategies per segment
- **Executive Summary**: Business-ready insights and next steps

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```yaml
# databricks.yml variables
variables:
